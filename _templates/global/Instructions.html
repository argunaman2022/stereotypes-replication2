      This study consists of two parts. 
      <ol>
         <li>First, you will play the "{{Treatment}} game". Here, you will have <strong>2 minutes</strong> to score as many points as you can (explained below).</li>
        <li> Second, you will be asked to make a guess about other participants' performance (explained later). </li>
      </ol>
     
      
      <h3 class="center">The {{Treatment}} Game</h3>
    <p>
      You will see boxes with 16 cells. 
      Each cell hides a simple addition of two one-digit numbers (e.g., 1+2) and a red or black heart.
      Your task is to click on cells to find matching pairs based on the conditions below.
     
      For two cells to be a match two conditions must be met:
      <ol>
        <li> the addition must be the same </li>
        <li> the hearts must be the same color </li>
      </ol>
      In each box, there are in total 8 matching pairs. 
      Each time you find a matching pair, the two cells will disappear. 
      Once you find all the matching pairs in one box, another box will appear.
      <br><br>  
      Each pair you find, earns you one point!
      Keep in mind that your performance in this task may be influenced by your <strong>{{Skill}} skills</strong>.
      

      <br><br>
      <h5><strong>Examples</strong></h5> 
      In the picture below, there are two examples. 
      At the top picture, although the numbers match (3+4 and 5+2 both equal 7), the colors of the hearts do not match, so it is not a valid pair.
      But at the bottom picture, both the numbers and the colors match, making it a valid pair.

    <h3 class="center">Payment</h3>

    <p> 

      Your payment consists of a <strong>completion payment</strong> and a <strong>bonus payment</strong>.
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Completion payment.</strong> If you successfully complete the study, you will receive a completion payment of ${{C.Completion_fee}}. </li>
       <li><strong>Bonus payment. </strong>In addition, you can earn a bonus payment of up to ${{C.Max_bonus}}.
          This bonus depends on your performance in the two parts. The computer will randomly select one of the two parts to determine your bonus.
          To maximize your bonus, we recommend that you do your best in both parts. The exact details will be explained at the beginning of each part.
