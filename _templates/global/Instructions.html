    In this study, you will play a {{Treatment}} game. You will have <b>2 minutes</b> to score as many points as you can. 
      <br><br>
      <h3 class="center">{{Treatment}} Game</h3>
    <p>
      <h5>Game</h5>You will see a box with 16 cells. 
      Behind each cell, there is a simple addition of two one-digit numbers (e.g. 1+2) and a red or black heart. 
      Your task is to find the matching pairs by clicking on the corresponding cells. 
      For two cells to be a match two conditions must be met: first, the addition must be the same, and second, the hearts must be the same color. 
      <br><br>

      <h5>Scoring points</h5> Once you find a matching pair, these cells will disappear.
       Once you find all matching pairs in one box, another box with 16 cells will appear.
        Each pair found counts as one problem correctly solved!
          We expect that those with stronger <b>{{Skill}} skills</b> will perform better. 

      <br><br>
      <h5>Example</h5> An example problem is depicted below. 
      In this picture, 1+2 and 3+0 are matching pairs, since they both equal 3 and they both have a red heart.
       Clicking on these two cells leads to a correct solution
