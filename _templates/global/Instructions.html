      This study consists of two parts. 
      <ol>
         <li>First, you will play a Memory game. You will have <strong>2 minutes</strong> to score as many points as you can in this game (explained below).</li>
        <li> Second, you will be asked to make a guess about other people's performance (explained later). </li>
      </ol>
     
      
      <h3 class="center">{{Treatment}} Game</h3>
    <p>
      In this game, you will see boxes with 16 cells. 
      Each cell hides a simple addition of two one-digit numbers (e.g., 1+2) and a red or black heart.
      Your task is to click on cells to find matching pairs based on the conditions below.
     
      For two cells to be a match two conditions must be met:
      <ol>
        <li> the addition must be the same </li>
        <li> the hearts must be the same color </li>
      </ol>
      Each time you find a matching pair, the two cells will disappear.
      Once you find all matching pairs in one box, another box with 16 cells will appear.
      Each pair found counts as one problem correctly solved!
      <br><br>
      Your performance might be affected by your <strong>{{Skill}} skills</strong>.

      <br><br>
      <h5><strong>Example</strong></h5> An example problem is depicted below. 
      In this picture, 1+2 and 3+0 are matching pairs, since they both equal 3 and they both have a red heart.
       Clicking on these two cells leads to a correct solution

    <h3 class="center">Payment</h3>

    <p> 

      Your payment consists of a <strong>completion payment</strong> and a <strong>bonus payment</strong>.
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Completion payment.</strong> If you successfully complete the study, you will receive a completion payment of {{C.Completion_fee}}. </li>
       <li><strong>Bonus payment. </strong>In addition, you can earn a bonus payment up to {{C.Max_bonus}}.
          Your bonus depends on your performance in the two parts. The computer will randomly select one of the two parts to determine your bonus.
          To maximize your bonus, we recommend that you do your best in both parts. The exact details will be revealed later.
