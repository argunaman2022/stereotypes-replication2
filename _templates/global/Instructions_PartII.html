               Thank you for finishing the <strong>{{Treatment}}</strong> game and welcome to Part II of the study. 
           </li>
           <li>
               Along with you, multiple other Prolific participants have finished Part I. 
           </li>
           <li>
               In this part, we will ask you 4 questions regarding the performance and choices of other participants. 
           </li>
           <br>
           <strong>Bonus</strong>
           <li>
               If the computer chooses Part II to determine your bonus,
               then it will randomly choose one of the four questions from this part to compute your bonus payment.
           </li>
           <li>
               If your answer to that question is within 20% of the correct answer, you will earn a bonus of ${{C.Max_bonus_beliefs}}.
               For instance, if the correct answer is 100 and your guess falls between 80 and 120, then you will earn the bonus. 
               If your answer is outside of this range, you will not earn the bonus.
               Therefore, in order to maximize your bonus, <strong>try to be as accurate as possible in your guesses.</strong>
